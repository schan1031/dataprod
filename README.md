## Data Product Web App

This web app is an example of how to create an interactive web app using Shiny in Rstudio.

The first input is a quick use of a user entry for how many cylinders a car has. The server responds with which cars in the mtcars dataset contain the specified number of cylinders.

The second input is the slider bar for the predicted average of the magnitude of earthquakes in and near Fiji.
The graph is displayed with a marker showing the predicted average, and a live calculation of the mean and mean squared error is shown.
